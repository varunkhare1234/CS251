\section{Sholay}
This is a really old movie from 1975. Its cast has many famous actors like Dharmendra, Hema Malini, Sanjeev Kumar, Amitabh Bachan etc.
\\
This movie has excellent dialogues, excellent music and an interesting story/plot. The story is about a former policeman(Sanjeev Kumar) whose family is murdered by a bandit. This incident makes the police officer enlist the services of two outlaws Veeru (Dharmendra) and Jai (Amitabh Bachchan) to capture the notorious dacoit Gabbar Singh (Amjad Khan).
\\
Inspite of being one of the most techinically correct movies I have noticed a few mistakes here and there, I have noticed just two see if you can find more;

1) When Amitabh and Dharmendra do a runaway from prison, they go to Surma Bhopali to collect their share of money (1000 bucks), Dhamendra says ``surma bhai hum apne hazar rupey le ne aaye hai" after a brief pause Surma bhopali says ``acha acha hazar rupey...........doo soo ke das hai gin lo" But 10x200=2000 bucks. I am not sure why he got paid extra?

2) When Amitabh ''dies'' in the lap of Dharmendra, initially hig legs appear to be crossed. But, after some time they appear wide and separate. Probably, an editing error.
\\
I would say that if you liked "Once upon a time in the west", "The magnificent seven" and "A fistful of dollars", you would definitely love "Sholay". It takes all the good ingredients of a western, spices it with a lot of Indian ingredients and lets it cook until you get one of the finest "curry" Bollowyood movie. 
It's a movie that you can watch many times, and hardcore Bollywood fans do. But even if you just watch Sholay once, you won't be disappointed. Almost everyone in India knows of this amazing piece of work. 
\\
If you have not watched this move, then make definitely make it your priority to watch it at least once in your life, as this is definitely one of the movies that every person needs to experience.
